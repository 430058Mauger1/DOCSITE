# Thinking like a computer scientist
https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/colwestanglia-ebooks/reader.action?docID=5645560

## A computational thinking
+ decomposition/ breaking problem down into smaller pieces
+ Abstraction/ removing all non essential features from a problem
+ Pattern Recognition/ is this similar to another problem
+ Algorithm design/ can we reduce this to step by step instructions

## B Standard methods and techniques used to develop algorithms

## Selection sort

abstraction- finding the minimum or maximum element in an unsorted array and then putting it in its correct position in a sorted array.
doesn't have to be numbers.

decomposition- The minimum element in the array i.e. 2 is searched for and then swapped with the element that is currently located at the first position, 7 Now the minimum element in the remaining unsorted array is searched for and put in the second position, and so on. breaking it down in to smaller problem

pattern recognition- the problem is the same as the bubble sort the solution is different

## C Programming paradigms
paradigm- patterns that we use for programming

+ Object - oriented
Data driven- about encapsulating objects - data and methods to change it.
C#, Python, JS

+ Functional
Create everything as pure functionary.
Python, JS, C#, F#, Scala

+ Procedural
List of instructions, how to - begin to - stop here.
Any language

+ Event - driven
Event handlers responding to events.
C#, JS

Programs can use more then one.

## Identifier

anything we need to assign a name. represents the address in ram not the value.

apple 
apple 5
5 apple no! not allowed to start with integers.
apple. no!
apple; no!
apple_sauce
Apple
aPPle

### Boolean operators

### Modulus operators

% - gives the integer remainder

## What is a pure function?

- Its a function, accepts inputs returns a single value.
- Its repeatable, given the same arguments it always produces the same results.
- No side affects, doesn't change anything outside of the function.

## Python MAP

MAP is a built in function so you don't need to import it.

iterable- anything wih the concept of next and previous.

go's through the items one by one for memory efficiency.

## Lambda functions

Used to define functions on the fly.

parameters are needed when more then one parameters are called or no parameters are called.
